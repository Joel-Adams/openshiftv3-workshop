Using the Web Console
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this lab exercise, we will review the OpenShift Web Console.

Enter the master public URL provided by your instructor in a browser.
Use `<master public URL>:<port>`. You will be directed to the OpenShift
login page.

*Note*: Your browser may complain about the serverâ€™s security
certificates not trusted by your computer. You can agree to proceed to
the master URL.

Key in the username and password provided by the instructor. You will
see the list of projects now. Note the project you created in the last
lab exercise `mycliproject-UserName` is displayed here.

Also note the *New Project* button which allows you to create a new
project from Web Console.

Click on the `mycliproject-UserName` CLI Project to view the details. OpenShift takes you by
default to the *Overview* page and displays a graphic representation of
the application that is deployed here. You can see that a single pod is
running and is front-ended by a service. Note the route that you
configured for this service is also displayed. Also notice the *Add to
Project* button at the top, which can be used to create a new application
from the Web Console inside this project.

Select *Builds* under the *Builds* tab. All of the build
configurations will be displayed. Click into each build configuration and select the
*Configuration* tab, where you will be able to view all of the build details.

Select *Pods* under the *Applications* tab. Here you will find a running pod that
is executing your application image. Note that it also tells you the node
on which the pod is running and other details about this pod. You should
also see the build pod that has succeeded.

Click into the running pod. Details for the pod will be displayed. In addition,
metrics, logs and the ability to launch a terminal session into the running pod
are all available for monitoring and troubleshooting purposes.

Click on the *Terminal* tab, and access the pod from web console. Execute the `exit`
command within the terminal session when complete.

If you click into the *Metrics* tab under Pod and get an error viewing
metrics on the browser, please do the following:

1.  Open https://hawkular.<>/hawkular/metrics from a new tab on the same
broswer
2.  Click ``Advanced'' link
3.  Click ``Proceed to hawkular.<> (unsafe)''
4.  Refresh the browser where you login at OpenShift console.

Click *Builds* on left menu and select *Builds*. Select the build name
*time* and then click on the *Configuration* tab. Note there are webhook
URLs. We will use them in a later lab exercise. You can start a build
from the Web Console by pressing the *Start Build* button in the right
top corner. It also provides a command to start the build from CLI.

* Select *Services* under the *Applications* tab, you will find the service
created for your application. Click onto one of the services, it shows
all the details about the service along with the option to expose it as
a route.
* Select *Routes* under *Applications* tab, you will see all the routes
in the project. Click onto a route, it shows all the details for this
route.
* Select *Deployments* under *Applications* tab, you will see all the
deployments. Click onto a deployment, it shows all the details of the
deployment. By pressing the *Deploy* button, you will be able to start a
deployment from the web console.
* Select *Monitoring* tab, you will see all the events for the project.
Also latest events grouped by resource type.
* Select *Images* under *Builds* tab, it shows the list of image streams
for the project. Click onto the specific image stream, it shows more
details about the image stream.

Click on the *Resources* tab on the left to see that it would display
the Quotas and Other Resources, if they exist. We will deal with them in
a different lab exercise.
