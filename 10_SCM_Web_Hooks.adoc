SCM Web Hooks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OpenShift offers several mechanisms for triggering the automatic deployment
of applications. In this Lab, we will demonstrate the deployment of an application via a GitHub Web Hook trigger.

[[part-i]]
Part I
~~~~~~

In this portion of the Lab we will:

* Create a new project.
* Deploy an application using a source to image strategy.
* Create a route to expose the newly deployed application.

*Step 1: Create new project*

*Remember* to replace *UserName* with the username assigned to you in the commands below.

....
$ oc new-project scm-web-hooks-UserName --display-name="Test WebHooks"
....

*Step 2: Create new application*

* We will fork the repository from the previous lab on GitHub.

*Remember* to replace *your_github_username* with your GitHub account username.

....
$ oc new-app --image-stream=php --code=https://github.com/your_github_username/bluegreen.git --name=scm-web-hooks
....

*Step 3: Review the resources that were created*

* Build configuration

....
$ oc get bc
....

* Deployment configuration

....
$ oc get dc
....

* Show created service

....
$ oc get service
....

* Show replication controller

....
$ oc get rc
....

* Show route

....
$ oc get route
....

Notice that there is no replication-controller or route for this application at the moment.

* Show the builds in progress (Running)

....
$ oc get builds
NAME              TYPE      STATUS    POD
scm-web-hooks-1   Source    Running   scm-web-hooks-1-build
....

* Monitor the build

....
$ oc logs build/scm-web-hooks-1
....

The build should finish similar to:

....
...
Pushing image docker-registry.default.svc:5000/scm-web-hooks-UserName/scm-web-hooks:latest ...
Pushed 0/6 layers, 2% complete
Pushed 1/6 layers, 23% complete
Pushed 2/6 layers, 43% complete
Pushed 3/6 layers, 60% complete
Pushed 4/6 layers, 77% complete
Pushed 5/6 layers, 95% complete
Pushed 6/6 layers, 100% complete
Push successful
....

*Step 4: Create a route*

....
$ oc get service

NAME            CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
scm-web-hooks   172.30.71.191   <none>        8080/TCP   4m
....

*Remember* to replace the *UserName*...

....
$ oc expose service scm-web-hooks --hostname=scm-web-hooks.UserName.apps.osecloud.com
NAME            HOST/PORT                                  PATH      SERVICE         LABELS              TLS TERMINATION
scm-web-hooks   scm-web-hooks.UserName.apps.osecloud.com             scm-web-hooks   app=scm-web-hooks   
....

*Step 5: Test the application*

* If desired verify via `oc get route`
....
$ oc get route
NAME            HOST/PORT                                      PATH      SERVICES        PORT       TERMINATION   WILDCARD
scm-web-hooks   scm-web-hooks.UserName.apps.osecloud.com                 scm-web-hooks   8080-tcp                 None
....

* Use the newly created route URL via browser, you should see:

Part II
~~~~~~~

At this point, you have an application with one single replica running
inside a docker container in OpenShift. We used the source code retrieved
from the git repository and layered it using a builder or image stream
strategy; in this particular case, the php image stream.

For this portion of the Lab we will:

* Create a web hook for the recently deployed application.
* Make a small change to the application.
* Test to make sure the application was re-deployed.

*Step 1: Retrieve the OpenShift Web Hook URL*

* Navigate to the OpenShift Web console and login.
* Select your *Test WebHooks* project, and using the *Builds* menu on the left, click
*Builds*.
* Click onto the build name from the list. You should have just one in
this case.
* Click *Configuration* tab to get list of *Triggers* for the GitHub
link.
* Copy the *GitHub webhook URL*. You will need this URL for next step.

*Step 2: Configure GitHub repository Web Hook*

* Login to your GitHub account.
* Navigate to the forked repository you used to create the application.
* Click on Settings.
* Click on Webhooks.
* Click on the *Add webhook* button.
* Add the recently copied Web Hook URL from OpenShift.
* Change the Content-type as ``application/json''
* Click on the *Disable SSL Verification* button.
* Confirm by adding the *Add Webhook* button in green at the bottom of
the page.

*Step 3: Redeploy the application*

* In your GitHub account, within the forked project repository, edit the `image.php` file.
* Comment out the imagefilledrectangle() line
* Add the following after the line just commented out:
....
ImageFillToBorder($im, 0, 0, $white, $white);
imageRectangle($im, 0, 0, 199, 199, $color);
....
* Commit the file.

*Step 4: Monitor new deployment process*

* After saving/committing the `image.php` file with the small change,
you’ll notice in the OpenShift Web Console that a new build process has
been automatically triggered. *You didn’t have to start a build
yourself.*
* Monitor the build process using:

....
$ oc get builds

$ oc logs build/the-new-build-process-name
....

After a new pod is deployed, refreshing the browser should reveal a blue square outline with a white center.

Summary
~~~~~~~

In this Lab, we have demonstrated how simple it is to configure automatic
deployments of applications using OpenShift and GitHub Web Hook
triggers. Additionally, it should be noted that OpenShift also supports Generic Web
Hooks.
