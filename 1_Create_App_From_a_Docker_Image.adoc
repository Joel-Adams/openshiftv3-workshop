Create an App from a Docker image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this lab you will learn how to create a new project on OpenShift and
how to create an application from an existing docker image.

*Step 1: Add a new project from command line*

*Note:* Please replace *UserName* with the username assigned to you in
the commands below.

....
$ oc new-project mycliproject-UserName --description="My CLI Project" --display-name="CLI Project"
....

Upon project creation, OpenShift will automatically switch to the newly
created project/namespace. If you wish to view the list of projects, run
the following command:

....
$ oc get projects
....

If you have more than one project, you can switch to a different one by
issuing `oc project <project name>`. Although you donâ€™t want to do it
now.

You can also check the status of the project by running the following
command. It says that the project is currently not running anything.

....
$ oc status

In project CLI Project (mycliproject-UserName)

You have no services, deployment configs, or build configs.
Run 'oc new-app' to create an application.
....

*Step 2: Create an application from a Docker Image*

Next we will create an application inside the above project using an
existing docker image. We will be using a very simple docker image on
dockerhub that just says ``Welcome to OpenShift V3''.

First create a new application using the docker image using the
`oc new-app` command as shown below:

....
$ oc new-app redhatworkshops/welcome-php --name=welcome

--> Found Docker image f001b13 (8 months old) from Docker Hub for "redhatworkshops/welcome-php"

    * An image stream will be created as "welcome:latest" that will track this image
    * This image will be deployed in deployment config "welcome"
    * Port 8080/tcp will be load balanced by service "welcome"
      * Other containers can access this service through the hostname "welcome"
    * WARNING: Image "redhatworkshops/welcome-php" runs as the 'root' user which may not be permitted by your cluster administrator

--> Creating resources with label app=welcome ...
    imagestream "welcome" created
    deploymentconfig "welcome" created
    service "welcome" created
--> Success
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.
....

The above command uses the docker image `redhatworkshops/welcome-php` and deploys the image as a container in
a pod. Quickly run `oc get pods`  ...if you are fast enough, you will notice that a deployer
pod runs and it starts an application pod as shown below.

....
$ oc get pods

NAME               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
welcome-1-deploy   1/1       Running   0          1m
welcome-1-dkyyq    0/1       Pending   0          0s
....

In the above example `welcome-1-deploy` is the deployer pod and the
second pod is the actual application pod. Once the deployer pod succeeds,
the application pod will change from `Pending` to `Running` status.

....
$ oc get pods

NAME              READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
welcome-1-dkyyq   1/1       Running   0          56s
....

*Step 3: Add a Route for your application*

OpenShift also spins up a service for this application. Execute the
command `oc get services` to view the list of services in the project. *Note*: 
`svc` is short hand for `service` so you can alternately use the command
`oc get svc`

....
$ oc get services

NAME      CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
welcome   172.30.77.93   <none>        8080/TCP   2m
....

Notice the `welcome` service was created for this project.

However, there is currently no route defined for this application, so access to the
application is unavailable outside of the cluster.

Now add a route to the service. The `oc expose` command will expose your service to
the world so that it can be accessed externally.

*Note*: In the below example, the domain name of
`apps.osecloud.com` is used. *Ask the instructor for the domain name suffix* for
your environment and substitue it where `apps.osecloud.com` is used below. Also, remember to
replace *UserName* with the username assigned to you.

....
$ oc expose service welcome --name=welcome --hostname=welcome.UserName.<<DomainNameSuffix>>

NAME      HOST/PORT                     PATH      SERVICE   LABELS
welcome   welcome.UserName.apps.osecloud.com             welcome   
....

*Step 4: Access your application*

Test access to the application using curl (looking
for 200 status code) or from a browser and verify the result.

....
$ curl -Is http://welcome.UserName.<<DomainNameSuffix>>
....

Voila!! You created your first application using an existing docker
image on OpenShift.

*Step 4: Clean up*

Run the `oc get all` command to view all the components that were
created in your project.

....
$ oc get all

NAME      TYPE      SOURCE
NAME      TYPE      STATUS    POD
NAME      DOCKER REPO                   TAGS      UPDATED
welcome   redhatworkshops/welcome-php   latest    5 hours ago
NAME      TRIGGERS                    LATEST VERSION
welcome   ConfigChange, ImageChange   1
CONTROLLER   CONTAINER(S)   IMAGE(S)                             SELECTOR                                        REPLICAS
welcome-1    welcome        redhatworkshops/welcome-php:latest   deployment=welcome-1,deploymentconfig=welcome   1
NAME      HOST/PORT                     PATH      SERVICE   LABELS
welcome   welcome.apps.osecloud.com             welcome   
NAME      LABELS    SELECTOR                   IP(S)           PORT(S)
welcome   <none>    deploymentconfig=welcome   172.30.155.37   80/TCP
NAME              READY     REASON    RESTARTS   AGE
welcome-1-8d7nk   1/1       Running   0          4h
....

Now you can delete all components via one command:

....
$ oc delete all --all

imagestream "welcome" deleted
deploymentconfig "welcome" deleted
route "welcome" deleted
service "welcome" deleted
pod "welcome-1-ynedb" deleted
....

Notice that the imagestream for the application, the deploymentconfig,
the service and the route have all been deleted.  If you would like to delete all components, as well
as the project itself, then the following command will delete the entire project:

`oc delete project <project_name>`

If desired, run `oc get all` again to verify that the project is empty.

Congratulations!! You now know how to create a project, an application
using an external docker image and navigation in general. Get ready for more
fun stuff!
