Code Promotion across Environments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this lab we will learn how an application image binary can be
promoted across the environments. As an example we will use Development
and QA environments as promotion to Pre-Prod and Production will be very
similar.

In this example, projects will be used as a means of separation between different environments (Development, QA, Production).

*Step 1: Create two projects*

Using the knowledge gained from previous labs, create two projects.
*Remember* to replace *UserName* with the username assigned to you in the commands below.

Name the first project *development-UserName* 

....
$ oc new-project development-UserName
....

Name the second project *testing-UserName*
....
$ oc new-project testing-UserName
....

*Step 2: Provide ImagePuller Access to the QA Project from Development project*

The following command will allow the QA project to be able to pull the container images from the Development project.

....
$ oc policy add-role-to-group system:image-puller system:serviceaccounts:testing-UserName -n development-UserName
....

*Step 3: Create an application in the Development project*

Switch over to the *development-UserName* project and deploy an
application using the `php` s2i builder. Utilize either webconsole or
command line. The command line option is shown below.

*Bonus points:* Clone this application to your own GitHub account and
deploy it locally, providing the capability to redeploy with changes later.

....
oc project development-UserName
oc new-app openshift/php~https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/welcome-php
....

*Step 4: Tag the container image*

Wait until the application gets built and deployed. Checking the
imagestreams, a docker image for this application should be present.

Find the imagestream name using the command below. *Note:* `is` is
short hand for `imageStream`.

....
$ oc get is
NAME          DOCKER REPO                                                       TAGS      UPDATED
welcome-php   docker-registry.default.svc:5000/development-UserName/welcome-php
....

Execute the describe subcommand against this image stream to list the full image id:

....
$ oc describe is welcome-php
Name:			welcome-php
Namespace:		development-UserName
Created:		7 minutes ago
Labels:			app=welcome-php
Annotations:		openshift.io/generated-by=OpenShiftNewApp
			openshift.io/image.dockerRepositoryCheck=2017-08-21T23:24:26Z

....

In the above example, the full image Id is:
`docker-registry.default.svc:5000/development-UserName/welcome-php@sha256:157334d73dfc8dfdf733257b05c3fecaee236d36f69afa207395715fbe882abf`

Let's assume that this container image is good and is ready to promote
to QA. Tag this container image using the `oc tag` command.

The format is:

....
oc tag FullImageId development-UserName/myapp:promote-qa
....

Check the commands below and replace the values where needed:

....
$ oc tag \
docker-registry.default.svc:5000/development-UserName/welcome-php@sha256:157334d73dfc8dfdf733257b05c3fecaee236d36f69afa207395715fbe882abf \
development-UserName/welcome-php:promote-qa

Tag welcome-php:promote-qa set to docker-registry.default.svc:5000/development-UserName/welcome-php@sha256:157334d73dfc8dfdf733257b05c3fecaee236d36f69afa207395715fbe882abf.

....

*Step 5: Deploy the application to QA*

Now switch over to the QA project and deploy the container image
that was tagged in Development. Also, expose the service to create a route for
this project and *remember* to substitute username.

....
oc project testing-UserName
oc new-app development-UserName/welcome-php:promote-qa
oc expose service welcome-php
....

Test the application in the QA project. Note that the
container image was deployed from the Development project without rebuilding the code.

*Bonus points*: Make changes to your git repo (to
`index.php`) and deploy it to the Development project first.
Notice that the changes made are seen only in the Development project. Repeat
the changes a couple of times. Now find the latest imagestream and tag
it as promote-qa. Watch that the QA project gets redeployed when you
update the new tag.

Congratulations!! You now know how to promote your application across
environments in OpenShift 3.
