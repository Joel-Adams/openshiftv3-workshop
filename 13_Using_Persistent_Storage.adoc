Using Persistent Storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The purpose of this lab is to demonstrate how you can request storage
from OpenShift and have it attach to your application.

Containers, by design, are ephemeral. In short, if you want your application
to store persistent data; you will need to attach to a backend storage system.

In this Lab, we will be:

* Deploying an application that takes uploads
* Upload a File, and delete the pod
* Attach persistant storage
* Upload a File, and delete the pod

*NOTE:* Typically, storage provisioning for OpenShift must be setup by the Operations Team before proceeding. For our Azure-specifc workshop, OpenShift has been deployed utilizing the Azure Storage Cloud Provider for Kubernetes. Any actions requiring persistent storage are automatically handled in the background via the OpenShift/Kubernetes Cloud Storage Provider intergration with Azure. 


*Step 1: Deploy Application*

Create a project called `storage-UserName` and deploy the application

....
oc new-project storage-UserName --description="My Storage-Project" --display-name="Storage Project"
oc new-app php~https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/openshift-php-upload-demo
....

Once the application is deployed (monitor via `oc get builds` and `oc get dc` ) expose the route:
....
$ oc get svc
NAME                        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
openshift-php-upload-demo   172.30.212.62   <none>        8080/TCP   2m

$ oc expose svc openshift-php-upload-demo
route "openshift-php-upload-demo" exposed
....

Visit your application ( `oc get route` for URL); it should look like this

*Step 2: Test with ephemeral storage*

Pick a file to upload and upload it to the app. Once uploaded you can view
a list of file when you click `List Uploaded Files`. It should look something
like this

image:images/list-uploaded-files.png[image]

You can see where the uploaded files are if you use `oc rsh`. They are uploaded 
under `/opt/app-root/src/uploaded`

....
$ oc get pods
NAME                                READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
openshift-php-upload-demo-1-build   0/1       Completed   0          10m
openshift-php-upload-demo-1-rdktr   1/1       Running     0          5m

$ oc rsh openshift-php-upload-demo-1-rdktr
sh-4.2$ ls -1 /opt/app-root/src/uploaded
shadowman.png
sh-4.2$ exit
....

Delete this pod.

....
$ oc delete pod openshift-php-upload-demo-1-rdktr
pod "openshift-php-upload-demo-1-rdktr" deleted
....

Now login to your new pod that got spun up. Your data is gone!
....
$ oc get pods
NAME                                READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
openshift-php-upload-demo-1-build   0/1       Completed   0          13m
openshift-php-upload-demo-1-wnv4r   1/1       Running     0          38s

$ oc rsh openshift-php-upload-demo-1-wnv4r
sh-4.2$  ls -1 /opt/app-root/src/uploaded
sh-4.2$ exit
....


*Step 3: Requesting Storage*

In OpenShift, Storage is abstracted out to where one simply "requests" storage
and it's up to the backend adminsitrator to provide the solution

On the Web Console, switch to the Storage Project, then on the left side navigation click on "Storage". You will be presented with the storage overview page.

image:images/storage-overview.png[image]

Click the "Create Storage" button. This will take you
to the "Create Storage" page.

image:images/create-storage.png[image]

Here you need to enter the following

----
* Storage Class: <provided by your instructor>
* Name: myclaim
* Access Mode: Shared Access (RWX)
* Size: 1 GiB
----

The `Storage Class` will be given to you by your instructor. The `Name` must be
unique to the project namespace. The `Access Mode` means "how many apps/pods can access
this storage". For shared storage, you'd choose `Shared Access (RWX)` (for File based storage like NFS); in this instance we are choosing block storage ie `Singe User (RWO)`. The `Size`
is set to `1 GB` just for testing.

Once you click on "Create" it will go from the `Pending` stage to `Bound`. You can see
this on the command-line by checking your `pvc` (which stands for Persistant
Volume Claim)

....
$ oc get pvc
NAME      STATUS    VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESSMODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
myclaim   Bound     pvc-c5de7bc2-2ccb-11e8-a6b6-000d3a73a0a7   1Gi        RWO           generic        4m
....

Get yourself familair with the configuration
....
$ oc get pvc myclaim -o yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  annotations:
    pv.kubernetes.io/bind-completed: "yes"
    pv.kubernetes.io/bound-by-controller: "yes"
    volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class: generic
    volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-provisioner: kubernetes.io/azure-disk
  creationTimestamp: 2018-03-21T05:50:34Z
  name: myclaim
  namespace: storage-UserName
  resourceVersion: "1387201"
  selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/storage-UserName/persistentvolumeclaims/myclaim
  uid: c5de7bc2-2ccb-11e8-a6b6-000d3a73a0a7
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
  volumeName: pvc-c5de7bc2-2ccb-11e8-a6b6-000d3a73a0a7
status:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi
  phase: Bound
....

We will now bind this storage to the application's path of where it is
storing the files. This is under `/opt/app-root/src/uploaded`. You need
to add the volume to the `deploymentConfig` of `openshift-php-upload-demo`.

....
$ oc volume dc/openshift-php-upload-demo  --add -t pvc --claim-name=myclaim --mount-path=/opt/app-root/src/uploaded 
info: Generated volume name: volume-c7jtb
deploymentconfig "openshift-php-upload-demo" updated
....

*Step 3: Testing Configuration*

This will trigger a new deployment. Once the pod is running, rsh to your pod to see the mount.

....
$ oc get pods
NAME                                READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
openshift-php-upload-demo-1-build   0/1       Completed   0          1h
openshift-php-upload-demo-8-16dzg   1/1       Running     0          1m

$ oc rsh openshift-php-upload-demo-8-16dzg
sh-4.2$ df -h /opt/app-root/src/uploaded/
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sde        976M  3.3M  906M   1% /opt/app-root/src/uploaded
....

Upload a file via the browser like before. Check the uploaded directory:
....
sh-4.2$ ls -1 /opt/app-root/src/uploaded/
shadowman.png
lost+found
sh-4.2$ exit
exit
....

After verification, delete the pod:

....
$ oc get pods
NAME                                READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
openshift-php-upload-demo-1-build   0/1       Completed   0          1h
openshift-php-upload-demo-8-16dzg   1/1       Running     0          2m

$ oc delete pod openshift-php-upload-demo-8-16dzg
pod "openshift-php-upload-demo-8-16dzg" deleted
....

A new pod will be launched. Log into the newly spunup pod and verify that your file is still there!

....
$ oc get pods
NAME                                READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
openshift-php-upload-demo-1-build   0/1       Completed   0          1h
openshift-php-upload-demo-8-4brh0   1/1       Running     0          58s

$ oc rsh openshift-php-upload-demo-8-4brh0
sh-4.2$ ls -1 /opt/app-root/src/uploaded/
shadowman.png
....

Accessing the application via browser should list the image as well as allow viewing by clicking on the image name.
