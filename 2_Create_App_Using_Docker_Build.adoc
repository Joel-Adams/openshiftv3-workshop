Create an App using Docker build
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this exercise we will learn how to create an application from a
Dockerfile. OpenShift takes a Dockerfile as an input and generates your
application docker image for you.

*Step 1: Create a project or use an existing project*

We will create a new project based on what you have learned in the previous
lab. Execute the following command to verify that the project exists. *Remember* to
replace *UserName* with the username assigned to you in the commands below..

....
$ oc project mycliproject-UserName
....

*Step 2: Create an application that utilizes a Dockerfile*

For this lab, we will use a project that has a Dockerfile present in a source code
repository. We will use a simple project on GitHub
(https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/time). The `rhel` folder from this GitHub
project is built starting with `rhel7` as the base image
defined in Dockerfile. Review the Dockerfile for this project. It
starts off with the `registry.access.redhat.com/rhel7` image. Next, it copies the
source code, which in this case is a simple `init.sh` file and then exposes port `8080`.
Review the `init.sh` script, which simply displays the current datetime. There is
also a PHP version of the same project available in the php folder if
you would like to use that. The php version behaves the same, in that it has a
`time.php` file that displays the time.

*Docker Build*: When OpenShift finds a Dockerfile in the source, it uses
this Dockerfile as the basis to create a docker image for the
application. In OpenShift, this is known as the `Docker Build` strategy and we will
cover more about it when we look at the build
configuration a couple of steps down the line. Once OpenShift builds the
application’s docker image, it is then stored in a local docker registry.
Later, this image is utilized to deploy the application in a running pod.

Now let’s create an application using this approach. We will execute the
`oc new-app` command by supplying the git uri as the parameter.

....
$ oc new-app https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/time --context-dir=rhel

--> Found Docker image 1d309a6 (6 weeks old) from registry.access.redhat.com for "registry.access.redhat.com/rhel7"

    * An image stream will be created as "rhel7:latest" that will track the source image
    * A Docker build using source code from https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/time will be created
      * The resulting image will be pushed to image stream "time:latest"
      * Every time "rhel7:latest" changes a new build will be triggered
    * This image will be deployed in deployment config "time"
    * Port 8080 will be load balanced by service "time"
      * Other containers can access this service through the hostname "time"
    * WARNING: Image "registry.access.redhat.com/rhel7" runs as the 'root' user which may not be permitted by your cluster administrator

--> Creating resources with label app=time ...
    imagestream "rhel7" created
    imagestream "time" created
    buildconfig "time" created
    deploymentconfig "time" created
    service "time" created
--> Success
    Build scheduled, use 'oc logs -f bc/time' to track its progress.
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.
....

Notice that OpenShift created a few things at this point. You
will find a buildconfig, deploymentconfig, service and imagestreams in
the above list. The application is not running yet. It first needs to be built
and deployed. Within a minute or so, you will see that OpenShift starts
the build.

*Step 3: Build*

Meanwhile, lets review the buildconfig by executing the command shown below.
*Note:* The `-o json` portion of the command specifies the output to be displayed in JSON format.

....
$ oc get bc time -o json

{
    "kind": "BuildConfig",
    "apiVersion": "v1",
    "metadata": {
        "name": "time",
        "namespace": "mycliproject-user10",
        "selfLink": "/oapi/v1/namespaces/mycliproject-admin/buildconfigs/time",

        },

        }
    },
    "spec": {
        "triggers": [
            {
                "type": "GitHub",
                "github": {
                    "secret": "1pOQJ1G5tr6M70CQ5779"
                }
            },
            {
                "type": "Generic",
                "generic": {
                    "secret": "Bge9C-De7rm9PPDG_EQR"
                }
            },
            {
                "type": "ConfigChange"
            },
            {
                "type": "ImageChange",
                "imageChange": {
                    "lastTriggeredImageID": "registry.access.redhat.com/rhel7@sha256:eac2421be7a6844a5c83b8f394d1f5f121b18fa4e455c5f09be940e0384a1d97"
                }
            }
        ],
        "runPolicy": "Serial",
        "source": {
            "type": "Git",
            "git": {
                "uri": "https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/time"
            },
            "contextDir": "rhel"
        },
        "strategy": {
            "type": "Docker",
            "dockerStrategy": {
                "from": {
                    "kind": "ImageStreamTag",
                    "name": "rhel7:latest"
                }
            }
        },
        "output": {
            "to": {
                "kind": "ImageStreamTag",
                "name": "time:latest"
            }
        },
        "resources": {},
        "postCommit": {}
    },
    "status": {
        "lastVersion": 1
    }
}
....

Notice in the above metadata output that:

 - the name of the buildconfig is set to `time`
 - the git uri points to the value provided in the `oc new-app` command
 - the Strategy.type is set to `Docker`
 
Strategy.type `Docker` indicates that the build will utilize the instructions in the Dockerfile to perform the docker build.

In a minute or so, the build commences. A list of builds can be displayed with the
`oc get builds` command. The build can also be initiated via the command
`oc start-build time` where ``time'' would be similar to what is displayed in the
buildconfig above.

....
$ oc get builds
NAME      TYPE      STATUS    POD
time-1    Docker    Running   time-1-build
....

Take note of the name for the build that is currently running i.e. time-1. We will use that
name to look at the build logs. Execute the command as shown below to display the build logs. This will run for a few minuntes. Notice that once the docker image creation step has successfully completed, OpenShift will begin the process of pushing the image to the internal docker registry...

....
$ oc logs build/time-1
....

....
 ...
 ...
 ...
Successfully built 56b7529b446c
Pushing image docker-registry.default.svc:5000/mycliproject-labuser01/time:latest ...
Pushed 0/5 layers, 4% complete

Pushed 2/5 layers, 42% complete
Pushed 3/5 layers, 63% complete
Pushed 4/5 layers, 81% complete
Pushed 5/5 layers, 100% complete
Push successful
....

In the log output above, notice the details regarding how the image is pushed to the local docker
registry. The registry can be reached via service name `docker-registry.default.svc` on port `5000`.

*Step 4: Deployment*

Once the image is pushed to the local docker registry, OpenShift will trigger
the deploy process. Let's review the deployment configuration by running the following command.
*Note:* `dc` is short hand for `deploymentconfig` so you can alternately use the command
`oc get dc`

And again, the output is specified to be JSON formatted.

....
$ oc get dc -o json

....

Note where the image is specified from. It shows that the deployment pulls
the image from the local registry (same service name and port as in
buildconfig) and the image tag is identical to what we built earlier. This
inidcates that the deployment step utilizes the application image which was previously built
during the build step.

If you display the list of pods, you’ll notice that the application gets
deployed quickly and starts running in its own pod...

....
$ oc get pods

NAME           READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
time-1-build   0/1       Completed   0          2h
time-1-rqa7c   1/1       Running     0          2h
....

*Step 5: Adding route*

The following steps are very much the same as what we performed in the previous exercise.
We will verify the service name and add a route to expose that service...

....
$ oc get services

NAME      CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
time      172.30.xx.82   <none>        8080/TCP   2h
....

...next, expose the service as a route...

....
$ oc expose service time

NAME      HOST/PORT   PATH      SERVICE   LABELS     TLS TERMINATION
time                            time      app=time
....

...and then verify that the route is exposed:

....
$ oc get routes

NAME      HOST/PORT                                                          PATH      SERVICES   PORT       TERMINATION
time      time-mycliproject-UserName.apps.osecloud.com                       time       8080-tcp   
....

*Note:* Unlike in the previous lab, this time we did not use the `--hostname`
parameter while exposing the service to create a route. OpenShift
automatically assigned the project name extension to the route name.

*Step 6: Run the application*

Now run the application by using the route you provided in the previous
step. Either use curl or your browser. The application displays the
time. *If you don’t provide time.php extension, it displays apache’s
default index page.*

....
$ curl time-mycliproject-UserName.apps.osecloud.com

Congratulations!!! In this exercise you have learned how to create, build
and deploy an application using OpenShift’s `Docker Build strategy`.
