Using SSL in your application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this exercise you will set up your application to encrypt traffic
with the OpenShift Wildcard certificate.

*Step 1: Switch to an existing project*

For this exercise, we will use an application that we created before. We
will be using the *mycliproject-labuser01* created in a previous
lab. Make sure to switch to that project by using the *oc
project* command. *Remember* to substitute UserName.

....
$ oc project mycliproject-UserName
....

*Step 2: View the routing config*

To view the routing config you will need to use the `oc get route`
command

....
$ oc get route/time -o yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  annotations:
    openshift.io/host.generated: "true"
  creationTimestamp: 2018-03-19T17:23:59Z
  labels:
    app: time
  name: time
  namespace: mycliproject-user01
  resourceVersion: "1201793"
  selfLink: /oapi/v1/namespaces/mycliproject-user01/routes/time
  uid: 4fb0b1f0-2b9a-11e8-bf01-000d3a73a0a7
spec:
  host: time-mycliproject-user01.somedomain.com
  port:
    targetPort: 8080-tcp
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: time
    weight: 100
  wildcardPolicy: None
status:
  ingress:
  - conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: 2018-03-19T17:23:59Z
      status: "True"
      type: Admitted
    host: time-mycliproject-user01.somedomain.com
    routerName: router
    wildcardPolicy: None
....

Note here that the `host:` is set to the FQDN that your application is
running on.

Currently the routing component of OpenShift 3 supports ports `80` and
`443`. When you first create your route, the mapping of `80` to your pod
is done automatically. There are a few things that need to be done in
order to get the `443` mapping to work.

*Step 3: TLS Edge Termination*

OpenShift has a _wildcard_ SSL certificate that it can use for any
application. We can use this SSL certificate to serve SSL from our
application without having to generate a cert of our own (which is
sometimes called SSL-offloading).

Edit your routing configuration:

....
oc edit route/time
....

Under the `spec:` section, you are going to add...
....
  tls:
    termination: edge
....
...between the `port:` and `to:` entries. Pay close attention to the spacing. It should look something like this:
....
apiVersion: v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  annotations:
    openshift.io/host.generated: "true"
  creationTimestamp: 2018-03-19T17:23:59Z
  labels:
    app: time
  name: time
  namespace: mycliproject-user01
  resourceVersion: "1342625"
  selfLink: /oapi/v1/namespaces/mycliproject-user01/routes/time
  uid: 4fb0b1f0-2b9a-11e8-bf01-000d3a73a0a7
spec:
  host: time-mycliproject-user01.somedomain.com
  port:
    targetPort: 8080-tcp
  tls:
    termination: edge
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: time
    weight: 100
  wildcardPolicy: None
status:
  ingress:
  - conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: 2018-03-19T17:23:59Z
      status: "True"
      type: Admitted
    host: time-mycliproject-user01.somedomain.com
    routerName: router
    wildcardPolicy: None
....

*Step 4: Verify*

Verify by visiting the time application via `https://` URI

*Note:* the OpenShift environment for these labs is utilizing a self-signed SSL certificate and as such,
any http/https communications is going to require:

* Accepting the certificate when accessing the https URL
* Utilizing the `--insecure` command switch when accessing the https URL via `curl`, ie:

....
    $ curl --insecure https://time-mycliproject-user01.somedomain.com
....

Congratulations!! In this exercise you have learned about service SSL
from your application
